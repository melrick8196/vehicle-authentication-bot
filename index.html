          <p>A common problem faced by people who travel to colleges is that they are stopped by the security personnel to check if the vehicle belongs to a student of that institution or not. This is solved by providing stickers to all the vehicles which belongs to the members of the institution .<p>

          <p>Our college BMSIT doesn't provide stickers to any vehicles. Hence the security personnel stops every vehicle in the morning to check for ID card of the person using the vehicle. Students are not happy about it. Using a sticker on the vehicle will solve the problem here but more often than not stickers are going to leave a mark behind on the vehicle which is not ideal.</p>

          <p>By having the a automated system to do this we can go a step closer in calling BMSIT campus as a 'Smart Campus'. </p>

          <p>Work of the security guards at the gate will also be reduced as they will just have to look at the signal given by the device in order to decide if the vehicle has permission to enter the premises or not.</p>

          <p>This results in a hassle-free environment near the entrance gates of the campus.<p>

          <p>The above mentioned problem is faced at a few apartment entrance as well and not only in colleges.</p>

          <p>The idea involves a camera module placed near the entrace. This module must have a clear sight of approaching vehicles and also be protected against rain and other elements. This camera will capture images of approaching vehicles.</p>

          <p>Once the image is captured, it is analyzed by image recognition algorithms which will recognise the number plates of the vehicles. These number plates are then matched with the registered numbers in the database and then decided if the vehicle is authorised to enter the premises or not. The system has a display screen which shows necessary details to the security personnel.</p>
          <p>All the data will be stored in a private network which will be accessed by the Raspberry Pi via a WiFi module. This data contains all the necessary information about the 'authorized' vehicles. The private data stored in the network can be updated through a web browser interface by a device connected to the same private network. A copy of necessary details is stored in the Raspberry Pi as well and is updated once a day by connecting to the private network.</p>

          <p>The system will need a external power supply for all the modules to be functional.</p>
          <p>Students will have to register themselves at the start of every academic year in order for their vehicle to be marked as 'authorised'.</p>
